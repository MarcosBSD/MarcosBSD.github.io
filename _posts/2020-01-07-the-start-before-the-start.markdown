100 Weeks! Only 100 weeks for me to finish the next part of my educational journey to becoming a computer scientist. 

We started Module 0 by putting together a weekly study schedule to adhere to while we work toward the finish line.  Since I started my new job on January 1, I had already performed this scheduling and surprisingly it looks like my new schedule is going to be great for our family.


I will be getting to bed fairly early during the week so I can wake up at 4:30 AM and get to a 5 AM F45 class Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. It is already kicking my butt but I feel myself getting stronger and I feel great afterwards. There is nothing like getting a tough workout in before most people are even thinking about waking up.  It also helps that my brain isn't awake enough to convince me to stay in bed.  Then I am home by 6AM to walk the dog, wake up my daughter at 6:30AM for the start of breakfast and our morning routines. 


I get to drop her off at pre-school, with plenty of time to read her some stories in class and chat with some of the other parents.  


Then it is back to the home office for a 9AM start building robots and writing code. Since my wife is picking up our daughter from her mother's house, I get to cook dinner for the family when I am done with my workday at 4PM and have a family meal before starting my weekly study sessions.  This will provide me a mental break to transition between work and school.
