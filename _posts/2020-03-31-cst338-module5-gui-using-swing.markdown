**GUI is learned late in the game with Java.  Do you think this is helpful or harmful and why?**
It is difficult to approach any GUI without understanding the basis of inheritance because every GUI framework requires extending classes. Without some background it may be overly complex to understand.  On the contrary, students would feel that their introductory programming courses more exciting if they could associate the work with the GUI based programs they are familiar with.

**Why do think that coding the Swing elements in Java would be more difficult compared to some other languages?**
I don't think that coding Swing is any more or less difficult compared to other languages. While some frameworks may have unique and simplified elements, as a whole, GUI design is approachable in every language as long as there is a framework to work from.

**Update your learning journal from what you experienced this week with the class.**
This week was a fun yet challenging assignment. My exposure to GUI design has been limited to desktop interfaces to robotic processes I am running on hardware. This has been primarily with TKinter for Python and Qt for C++.  It was interesting to work with Swing.
