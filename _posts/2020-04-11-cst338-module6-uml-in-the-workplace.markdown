**What experience do you have with UML diagrams?**\
My experience with UML diagrams have been mainly academic. \
\
**Are they used at your workplace?**\
We have used UML diagrams in my workplace, but we usually diagram our robotic processes by breaking them into a similar structure as MVC. Our robotic process workflow is broken up into the quadrants of robotics; perception, decision, control, and actuation. For each subsection we document the inputs and outputs from each quadrant and if the system is closed we verify all inputs and outputs close the loop.\
\*\*\*Have you done multithreading in any language before? \*\*\*\
I have done multithreading in Java and Python before. I also do async threading within ROS (Robotics Operating System) and psuedo-threading in microcontrollers like the Arduino.\
\
**Did you find Patterns to be helpful?**\
I absolutely find patterns to be helpful and try to implement them whenever possible to maintain organization.
