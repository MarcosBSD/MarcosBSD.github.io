**Have you ever created an app before, either for Android or iPhone?  How did it go?**
I have created a few prototype applications on Flutter using Dart. These apps can run on both Android and IPhone. While the apps were very simple I enjoyed the process as well as working with Firebase integration for cloud mobile device integration.

**Do you have any ideas for apps that you could create for recreation?  What about business?**
I am currently working on a mobile device enabled computer vision application for children. My plan is to connect the application to a kid friendly hardware device that kids can use to explore the world around them.
