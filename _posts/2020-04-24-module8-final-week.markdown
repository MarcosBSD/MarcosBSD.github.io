**They say hindsight is 20/20, what advice would you give to the next cohort regarding this course?**
Don't get sick in this program. You won't be able to recover the time lost. Also, start your final project before you even know what the specifications are because you will have a shorter amount of time to complete an assignment that is significantly more complex in scope than all the other assignments in class.

**How much do you envision using the skills you gained in this course in your career?**
I will definitely use design patterns in the future and I will also not use Java for Android development ever again. I found the entire stack cumbersome and convoluted. 

**Update your learning journal from what you experienced this week with class.**
Overall this week was a waste. I have been sick all week and bed ridden for three days so my ability to do my final assignment under the shortened time frame is not going to be possible. I just hope I don't fail the class.
